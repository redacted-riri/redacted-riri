👋 Hi, I’m @redacted-riri! This page is the beginning of something new right now!

- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 🌱 I am a budding software developer starting up with not much experience.
- 📖 I’m currently in my second year being an electrical and computer engineering student!
- 🤖 I'm on the OSU Lunabotics Electrical team and happily enjoy working on the electronics involved there!
- ✨ I lack a coherent theme in what my interests are right now and I am trying to think of fun projects to start.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a huge D&D fan 🎲
